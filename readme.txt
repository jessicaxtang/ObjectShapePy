This sample application demonstrates the use of the Motive API.

In order to run this application, if you have not already run Motive itself, run it once. It will generate a user profile (MotiveProfile.motive) and a calibration file (System Calibration.cal) that the sample will load and use.

Application Profile stores all of the software settings and asset definitions. This can be exported from Motive: Motive -> File tab -> Save Profile.

Calibration (CAL) file contains system calibration. After calibrating the camera system in Motive, export this file from Motive -> File tab -> Export Calibration.
